UHS is a confidential, non-judgmental place for students of all genders to discuss options, regardless if they were drinking. UHS can review the risk of pregnancy, STIs, and physical injuries with the student, and provide more information about reporting options, emotional support, and academic accommodations.

The SAFE Fund is a program that can provide financial assistance for the cost of a forensic medical exam for victims of sexual assault. The SAFE Fund can reimburse medical providers when a victim does not report the crime to law enforcement, does not wish to cooperate with law enforcement through prosecution, or does not wish to submit the bill to his or her insurance provider or be personally responsible for payment of the bill. The medical provider must apply for this benefit at victim's request.

Contact your House Fellow or a Housing staff member.
