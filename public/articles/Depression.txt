What is depression?
Depression is a mood disorder that occurs when feelings associated with sadness and hopelessness continue for long periods of time and interrupt regular thought patterns. It can affect your behavior and your relationship with other people. Depression doesn't discriminate-it can affect anyone of any age, gender, race, ethnicity, or religion. In 2012, an estimated 16 million adults experienced depression, according to the NIH.

It's normal for survivors to have feelings of sadness, unhappiness, and hopelessness. If these feelings persist for an extended period of time, it may be an indicator of depression. Depression is not a sign of weakness and it's not something you should be expected to snap out of. It's a serious mental health condition and survivors can often benefit from the help of a professional.

When should I get help?
You might have a difficult time coming forward about the possibility of depression because you think you're just feeling down. If these feelings are interfering with your daily life, know that there is help available.
